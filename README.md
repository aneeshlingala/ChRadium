# ChRadium
> Note: This project is independent from blendOS.

The "Ch" stands for Chlorine, used to clean up pools. This script removes chromeOS and replaces it with a clean, Arch Linux ARM or blendOS system.

## What is this?

Arch Linux ARM, Ubuntu, Debian, and blendOS (unsupported for now) for unsupported ARM Chromebooks

> Note: For blendOS developers, this is different from blendOS Builder.
